<h1> Chapter 2</h1>

<h2>  Day2 </h2>

<p>9 am. I open my eyes and get out of bed, before going to the bathroom i decided to look outside the window. For a moment i felt excitement as i saw something unexpected - More Snow!. With a joyin my heart i went to the bathroom to wash my teeth and get dressed.</p>

<p> After getting dressed i went downstairs to have a breakfast, Housemate was already in the kitchen watching video of is friend diving into the snow half dressed. I that instance i knew what my next spepps will be. I run upstairs to my bedroom and found swimming shorts, got undressed, put them on and run back to the kitchen where  a door to the garden is. I opened the dor and run...</p>

<p> Snow is very cold this time of year, especially when you lie in it wearing just swimming shorts, the satisfaction of diving into huge dune of snow worms me up. from the house i can hear my girlfrined shouting at me, i think she means that it was a stupid idea of what i did, but shes wrong. </p>

<p> its midday, i still feel very refreshed and full of energy after morning snow bath, but there is nothing to do. all shops are closed, there are no busses and i am stuck in the house. I san on the couch and watched television for most of the day with a cup of tea beside me.</p>
