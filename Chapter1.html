<h2>  Day 1: When the snow fell <h2>

<p> today was the the day that weather turned nuts </p>

<p> I woke up in the morning and saw what we would call in Poland "a standard winter", but for Dublin description would say atleast "odd". About 10 cm of snow was already lying on the ground, and more was comming heavily</p>

<p> after breakfast i went to the store for some supplies to survive this apocalipse. Websites claimed that tommorow all shops will be closed. <p>

<p> I spent most of the midday at home, the continously falling snow wasn't very plesent and now the wind also pisked up. i got myself a cup of cofee and worked on my school projects. This Major group Project is driving me nutts lately, im starting to think that i went a little too ambitious when deciding that my prject will be all "new technologies" to me insted of "something that i already know".</p>

<p>Its evening, i just heard on the news that all schools will be closed until the ond of the week. So friday is off, nice. I will now use some of the suppliies that i bought earlier on and make myself a dinner. <p>

<p>Its night now, with a bottle of wine im watching "taboo"</p>
