<h2> When the snow fell <h2>

<p> today was the the day that weather turned nuts </p>

<p> I woke up in the morning and saw what we would call in Poland "a standard winter", but for Dublin description would say atleast "odd". About 10 cm of snow was already lying on the ground, and more was comming heavily</p>

<p> after breakfast i went to the store for some supplies to survive this apocalipse. Websites claimed that tommorow all shops will be closed <p>
