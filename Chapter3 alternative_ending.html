<h2> Day 3: </h2>

<p> i lost count of how many days i spent seating on the cauch, was it one day or 2 days? i  cant remember. 
Lets call this day a day3- the thay the apocalypse goes away.</p>

<p> i wake up, its weekend so no school for today, for the past few days i got ussed to get up a little late (10am), so today i did the same and went back to sleep after waking up.</p>

<p> its 10 am, time to get up.i check the window to see whats the story with snow, i can see its melting. I go to batchroom and get dressed, walk down to the kitchen to have a breakfast, i put on my shues, jacket, and walk out the door.</p> 

<p> im headed for the dunnes store, i read on the google that its finally open. Altough the snow is melting ald half the ammount it was yesterday, its very difficult to walk, my shues are disastour for this kind of weather and im slipping and fighting to stay on my feat while walkig. </p>

<p> i reached dunnes. The qeues are MASSIVE!!! i have never seen a queue this long in this store before. awalk around to see whats left on shelfes, the majority of fresh products are gone. i came to buy a duck but there is none. i walk out with a chicken instead and head back home </p>


<p> in this ending i decided to have another day off and not to do Major group Poject today. I stayed in bed watching Taboo and when it was finished i downloaded 4th season of "Vikings"</p>

<p>4th season of vikings prooved to be so good that i watched it all in one go</p>


<p> its almost midnight, time to go to sleep</p>
