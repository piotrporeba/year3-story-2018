<h2> Day 3: </h2>

<p> i lost count of how many days i spent seating on the cauch, was it one day or 2 days? i  cant remember. 
Lets call this day a day3- the thay the apocalypse goes away.</p>

<p> i wake up, its weekend so no school for today, for the past few days i got ussed to get up a little late (10am), so today i did the same and went back to sleep after waking up.</p>

<p> its 10 am, time to get up.i check the window to see whats the story with snow, i can see its melting. I go to batchroom and get dressed, walk down to the kitchen to have a breakfast, i put on my shues, jacket, and walk out the door.</p>
